# NutriNudge: AI-Powered Product Recommender for Allergy-Aware Shopping</div>

Millions of people with allergies face a hidden danger when shopping online: Existing platforms lack personalised, allergy-aware product recommendations. Current recommendation algorithms often fail to consider dietary restrictions, leading to frustrating and potentially dangerous suggestions. This creates a poor shopping experience for those with specific dietary needs.

## Existing Solution

- Recommendation Engines
- Virtual Styling Assistants 
- Smart Search Functionality
- Product Reviews and Ratings

## Our Solution


Creating a web-based e-commerce platform with AI integration for customised product suggestions is the suggested approach. Features of this platform will include an interactive chatbot for product descriptions and recipes, an extensive user profile area, and AI-powered product filters that mainly focus on user allergies and health concerns. The system will also include methods for ongoing learning and user input, which will help the recommendation algorithm get better over time.

This project is to provide a distinctive e-commerce experience that meets the health and lifestyle demands of its consumers, giving it a competitive edge in the market, by tackling these issues and utilising the suggested solution.

By introducing allergy-aware models and a chatbot that has been carefully trained to provide recommendations depending on the user's allergies, we are further enhancing the user experience than the current solutions, which focus on personalizing user experiences.
